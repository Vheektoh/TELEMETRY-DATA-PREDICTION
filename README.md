# Vehicle Telemetry Data Analysis
This repository focuses on leveraging vehicle telemetry data collected via On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) systems
to address key challenges in modern automotive analytics. The projects use machine learning and deep learning 
techniques to extract actionable insights and make predictions, aiming to improve driving behavior analysis, 
vehicle maintenance, and environmental impact.

## Projects
- Driver Behavior Prediction: Classify driver behavior into categories such as normal, aggressive, or conservative
   using telemetry features like engine load, intake manifold pressure, braking patterns, and RPM.
- Predictive Maintenance: Predict the likelihood of vehicle maintenance requirements based on telemetry data and$
  trouble codes.
- CO2 Emissions Prediction: Estimate CO2 emissions based on telemetry features such as fuel level, engine load, RPM,
  and vehicle speed.
- Fuel Consumption estimation: Predict real-time fuel consumption using telemetry features including MAF (Mass Air Flow),
  throttle position, and short-term fuel trim bank.

## Dataset
The telemetry data utilized in these projects was obtained from OBD systems, which monitor vehicle performance and record 
vehicle features.
